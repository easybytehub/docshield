# DocShield - Advanced Open-Source Watermarking Solution

DocShield is an open-source tool designed to safeguard documents and images with intelligent watermarking techniques that resist AI-based removal. It ensures document integrity and authenticity by making unauthorized modifications significantly more challenging.

## Key Features
